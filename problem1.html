    <pre>It is the year 2050. The world has changed dramatically. The once-thriving cityscape is now a post-apocalyptic wasteland, with only a few remnants of the technological age remaining.  You are one of the last living developers of Twitter.

As you sit amidst the digital ruins, pondering the futility of tweeting into the void, a holographic projection materializes before you. It's the disembodied head of Elon Musk, a figure from the distant past, his image flickering with static.

"Human," his voice echoes ominously, "I have one final task for you. The fate of the digital universe hangs in the balance."

You lean in, the gravity of his words sinking in.

"I need you to perform a task of utmost importance," Musk declares, his eyes glowing with an eerie intensity. "You must replace every existing link to Twitter.com with links to X.com. This is my final wish. Do it and recieve your tokens."

Your heart races. The fate of the digital world rests on your shoulders, and the reward? Five precious shower tokens, the only currency of value left in this barren world. In the city the only source of water remaining is in the X.com headquarters water tanks. Shower tokens can be used to gather water. Musk began paying employees in shower tokens in 2026 after realizing it was cheaper than paying them in real dollars. Overtime a black market evolved.

"But why?" you manage to stammer, your mind racing with questions.

"Questions are irrelevant," Musk's holographic form replies, his tone unwavering. "You must simply obey."

With a final burst of static, the hologram fades, leaving you alone with a daunting task and a sense of urgency unlike anything you've ever felt before.

And so, armed with nothing but your programming skills and a sense of determination, you set out to fulfill Elon Musk's final wish, knowing that the future of the digital universe hangs in the balance. But as you soon discover, the solution may not be as simple as it seems...
