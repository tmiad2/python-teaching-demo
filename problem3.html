As you grapple with the complexities of navigating the digital wasteland, a familiar figure emerges from the shadows once more. It's `Ally X-422!4`, her presence commanding attention amidst the chaos of your thoughts.

"Fellow coder," she begins, her voice a steady beacon in the tumultuous sea of uncertainty, "I've seen the havoc wrought by the unchecked proliferation of Neo Australian Slang. It's a linguistic minefield, capable of wreaking havoc on our fragile digital ecosystem."

You nod, acknowledging the truth in her words. The rise of Neo Australian Slang has introduced a new level of unpredictability to online communication, creating rifts where there once were bridges and sowing discord among even the most resilient survivors.

"We cannot afford to ignore the threat it poses," Ally continues, her gaze unwavering. "Left unchecked, it has the potential to tear apart the very fabric of our digital society, undermining trust and eroding the bonds that hold us together."

"What's in it for me?" You ask.

"Eight shower tokens," she declares. "Write me a filter to remove NAS from posts and I will grant you eight of my remaining shower tokens.  Though you still owe me for the ones I lost thanks to your boneheaded text replacement."
