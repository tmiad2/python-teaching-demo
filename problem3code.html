    Using the list of NAS(Neo Australian Slang) strings in the variable `NAS_strings` which is just a python list in the global scope,  replace any instances of the strings in a given string `s` with asterisks(as many as there are letters in the word). For this problem feel free to just do string replacement again.  You may already be able to guess that there is going to be some issues arising from doing the obvious thing, but let's do it anyway(we could use the tokens). For now assume all text is lowercase.
