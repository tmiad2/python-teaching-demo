Escatic at your victory in restoring `Smazzle`'s name you sit in the dimly lit office hunched over lines of code. The faint glow of the screen illuminates your weary face as you sift through the digital debris of a bygone age.

Suddenly, a holographic projection flickers to life above your workstation, casting an ethereal glow across the room. It's the disembodied head of Elon Musk once again.

"Human." the spectral visage intones, its voice echoing with an eerie resonance. "I have a task for youâ€”one that may grant you access to the coveted Musk tokens."

You really should repay `Ally X-422!4` for her lost tokens.  You have been causing them too many issues lately.

"I need you to embark on a quest of lexical analysis," Elon Musk continues, his holographic gaze piercing through the digital veil. "Identify all the function calls in the labyrinthine depths of the codebase. Do this for me, and nine Musk tokens shall be yours."

With a mixture of trepidation and determination, you accept the challenge. In a world where survival hangs in the balance of digital prowess, every opportunity to prove your worth is not to be squandered.
